# Tasks
An intelligent cooler interacts with its surroundings and itself. 
- it tests its components for funcionality. If a defect is found the cooler sends a message to the repairservice and/or the owner. 
- it checks on a regular basis, what food it contains. 
- if a food runs out, it sends a message to the store, which sells the food. 
- the housekeeping robot informs the cooler, if a shipment has arrived.

Develop an object oriented model of an intelligent cooler by defining the objects and the methods, which they must have to do their jobs.
